**Craft Decoders for Machine Instructions, Binary Protocols, and Beyond**  

Decoder-forge is a *Python-powered toolkit* that generates source code for decoders used in decoding machine instructions (like ARMv7-M), structured data formats (e.g., MessagePack), and proprietary binary protocols. Whether youâ€™re reverse-engineering firmware, analyzing network packets, or debugging IoT devices, Decoder-forge transforms raw bytes into human-readable insights with flexibility and speed, allowing you to easily create and customize your own decoders.
