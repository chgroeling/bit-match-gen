    Construct a hierarchical decode tree of BitPattern objects grouped by shared fixed

    This function organizes the provided list of BitPattern objects into a tree
    structure. Each BitPattern is first extended to the desired decoder width by
    calling the extend_and_shift_to_msb() method, and then it is wrapped as a
    DecodeLeaf node and attached as a child of the root DecodeTree node. The tree is
    built iteratively by:

    1. Clearing the children of the current tree node.
    2. Grouping its BitPattern nodes by computing a common fixed mask and splitting them
       using split_by_mask.
    3. For each group:

       - If the group contains a single member, the fixed bits (outer portion) are
         combined with the remainder (inner portion) using combine(), and a DecodeLeaf
         is created.
       - If the groupâ€™s fixed portion has a non-zero fixedmask, a new DecodeTree is
         created with the corresponding DecodeLeaf children, and this subtree is
         scheduled for further processing.
       - Otherwise, the corresponding DecodeLeaf nodes are directly appended to the
         current node.

    Args:
       pats (list[BitPattern]): A list of BitPattern objects to be organized into the
